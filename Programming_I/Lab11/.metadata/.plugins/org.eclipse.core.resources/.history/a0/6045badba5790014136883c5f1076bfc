Using BufferedWriter

You can also write a new file in the following manner,

try{

  // Create file 
  FileWriter fstream = new FileWriter("out.txt");
  BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(fstream);

  out.write("Hello Java");

  //Close the output stream
  out.close();
  }

  catch (Exception e){
  //Catch exception if any
  System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
  }

Write a program that...

    accepts a filename from the user that indicates the input file
    obtains a filename to use as the output file
    asks the user if he/she wants to scan the file in a case sensitive manner ('y' for yes and 'n' for no)

        if the file could not be opened, you must ask the user for valid file name until one is given
    once a valid file name is given, print all of contents and store the analysis of the file in the output file name specified

You will be reading the input from a file and printing the output to another file.

For example, if the file input.txt contains:
