#Classwork

This repository contains scripts, programs, and software prepared for my coursework and lab assignments.  Divided by class, then by assignment.  I have also included some of the many programs written for the KU programming club.

My resume is available above in the main directory.  Credit to Cies Breijs for the Latex template, graciously shared under the [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) license on [his github repo](https://github.com/cies/resume).
