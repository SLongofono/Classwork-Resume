**Embedded Systems**

*This course is a laboratory course centered around ARM microcontrollers and the Stellaris LM3S1968 Evaluation Board.  We will be exploring the internal architecture and organization of the board through C and assembly language.  We will also prepare a small project demonstrate interaction with external devices and sensors.*
